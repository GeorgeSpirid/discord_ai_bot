# discord_ai_bot
You will need to create an .env file where you should add:
DISCORD_TOKEN="your_token_here"
COHERE_API_KEY="your_token_here"
You can get these tokens from the discord developer applications website when creating the bot and the cohere website after creating an account.
Then invite the bot to your server and run the code.
If you add "?" in the beggining of your message, the bot will send you a direct message, otherwise the message will appear in the channel you wrote.
The bot comes online when you start the program and goes offline when you stop it.
